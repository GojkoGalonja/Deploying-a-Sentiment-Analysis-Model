# Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
## Introduction
In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network or convolutional neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

## Project Instructions
The deployment project which you will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that you have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.

## Topics:
In this project, we cover several areas:
* Machine learning
* Natural language processing
* RNN (LSTM, GRU)
* Word embedding
* Pytorch
* AWS
* GPU computing
* End-to-end web application

The project can be extended to include the word2vec embedding (Skip Grams model, continuous-bag-of-words, negative sampling, etc):
